### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Scott Raymond. I am a fourth year university student at KCA University pursuing my Bachelors degree in  Software Development.
I am currently learning web development on Udemy and I am determined to become a full stack web developer by the end of 2023.
I am currently working on building my portfolio website as a start for my web development journey. 
I am looking to learn from more experienced developers in order to grow my coding skills and network as I prep myself for the job market.
I am also looking to work with other developers on coding projects so as to grow my collaboration and communication skills.
I am open to mentorship from any skilled and willing web developer who might be willing to share their knowledge and guide a newbie in this field.
